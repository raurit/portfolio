*Colored pencil, marker, newspaper; Rayne Aurit, April, 2025*

I made this collage during a joint meeting of oSTEM\@UNL and Mind and Craft. The frog in the chair is simply a coloring page using a variety of colored pencils that were provided, but also marker. For the chair, I used marker and then a lighter color over top the marker whereas the technique used in the rest of the coloring page were marker with a darker color. The lighter colored pencil on top created the texture of felt or velvet, especially since the sides of the couch chair had a darker color, implicating different interactions with light.

Meanwhile, the background is exempt from all traditional forms of art. They're ripped clippings from various magazines, mostly vintage aside from the picture frame and the lemons. The frog's attire seemed to match a more vintage aesthetic, so the clippings I chose reflected that. Colored pencils contrast well with black and white figures and text, emphasizing the frog character over the odd deer held up by two men in the background. They become less obvious easter eggs.

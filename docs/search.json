    "text": "Hello and welcome to the first post on my personal portfolio doubling as a page where I can dispense my thoughts and other items of personal interest.\n\nWhat to Expect\nThis portfolio will consist of updates on my professional journey and projects that I have been working on in class and in my own free time. As a statistics student, my goal of this year in preparing for graduate school is to take on more personal projects, especially as my repertoire of statistical skills becomes more full. With the department set up for elimination officially as of December 5th, 2025, self-study will be my greatest ally in keeping in touch with the knowledge that I have gained in undergraduate school while preparing to leave the state and finding a home for a graduate degree.\nI firmly believe in the goal of being well-rounded and not to narrow in on one specific skill. In addition to data analyses and educational projects, I also will post art projects and other creative projects. Originally, I used to post on Instagram, running an art account, until there was notice of posts on Instagram being scraped to use for training data on Meta’s LLMs and image-generating models. Since then, I have not found a place to host progress in my art journey. For those who are reading this to see data analyses or classwork, I hope you enjoy some color in between the technical writing.\n\n\nNew Year, New Me\nNot quite. Help setting up this portfolio is credited to Dr. Susan Vanderplas through a statistics course on technical writing. I expect that a large portion of updates will be a result of homework and projects from said course as well. Aside from that, my goals for this spring semester include:\n\nFinding 2 data sets to analyze and create visuals for\nPut coursework projects in this portfolio to display the progress of my learning\nSubmit 4 artworks for the Laurus, an undergraduate fine arts magazine\nCreate a new club to support those still interested in statistics despite the department’s elimination\n\nThese goals have no particular ordering as most are long term and will be steadily accomplished simultaneously- aside from artworks for the Laurus. Submissions are due on January 30th of this year and include works created throughout the past year, of which I already have two or three."

    "text": "Google and Data Centers\nGoogle’s data center went live this past year after a few years of development alongside interstate I-80 and 56th street. I am curious how Lincoln residents will feel the effects of the data center in these coming years in areas such as water quality and the cost of electricity. As a freshman, the topic of the local data center came up in discussion in my science literacy course underneath the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources. The unit that we were working on the time was water conservation after previously discussing plastic pollution. We were asked a question on if anybody knew if the data center was still being built as the site looked dormant for a long period of time, and the answer was yes. Originally, I felt proud of being the one to be able to answer the question and was aware about the development, though extremely naive and unaware of the impact of data centers in other areas of the country. I recalled Google as a great company with wonderful work experience. Those who were hired by Google were the best of the best and their facilities looked like adult playgrounds when images of them were introduced to me in middle school.\nSince then, they have notably taken off language in their corporate code of conduct. “Do no evil” was replaced with “Do the right thing.” It is a small, but noticeable semantic difference. While right and wrong is ambiguous in many cases, the notion of doing “no evil” brings about the mindset of avoiding harm at any costs. Doing “the right thing” may allow Google to weigh the costs and benefits of certain actions. If an action does “evil” but is arguably for the greater good and is a “right thing,” then it is an action that is justified within the code of conduct, allowing for “evils” to escape the same amount of scrutiny as before."

    "text": "OpenAI and RAM, an Aside\nLast summer, I got a new gaming laptop. My previous one had ran nearly completely out of storage, and it was one that I got at the beginning of Covid-19 pandemic with the intent that it was to be used for homework only. I got it before knowing that I was going to be a computer science student that would need to download and work with many different languages and their respective IDE’s. I had to rent a laptop from the university every week at the end of my sophomore year because I did not have enough space to download the extension to work with the raspberry pi’s at the end of the semester.\nLeading to now, I bought an HP Victus gaming laptop the summer of 2025 for around $500 during the summer sale. It came with only 8GB of RAM but the modular capability for more RAM to be installed easily. Back then, I could have gotten 32GB of RAM installed for only a hundred dollars. In September, OpenAI purchased 40% of NVIDIA’s stock of RAM to be used in data centers, causing surges in RAM prices for the average consumer of up to 500%. Half of what I paid for the laptop could be spent on getting a RAM upgrade. A similar trend was seen with graphic cards with the past few years as well."

    "text": "Grok, A Case Study in “Wokeness”\nGrok is the AI assistant built into the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. It is the most well-known of the LLMs to display the issues of not having regulation on artificial intelligence. In early July of 2025, Grok’s responses changed from being factual and unbiased to literally calling itself “MechaHitler” as the goal was to decrease the “wokeness” of its responses.\nElon Musk, the CEO of X, had reportedly said earlier “We have improved @Grok significantly.”1\nI am not sure what measure of improvement is evaluated when he says “improved,” but it certain increased in antisemetic, hateful statements, of which some users got the LLM to state that there was a need for a second Holocaust and that Adolf Hitler was justified in his actions. This result was from a change in the initial prompts for the LLM. Having worked with LLMs in creating an AI agent framework and running models locally, the system prompts before any person starts to interact with the LLM is deeply important. Studying prompt engineering and having knowledge of an LLMs context window and memory capabilities in terms of how many parameters were used in creating the model directly contributes to the behavior of the LLM, including its reliability. The specific change with Grok was to change the wording in its system prompt to include: “not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated….”\nTo define political correctness in this case, it is often negatively associated with being “woke,” which is to be aware of the social biases and systemic inequalities towards certain groups of people whether it is due to their race, gender, or sexual orientation. It usually is said in reference of people who are more strict about the specific terms they use and their social openness to other groups of people. Someone would be called “woke” for including their pronouns in their bio or on their name tag or calling out people who misuse hateful terms. As being politically correct or woke- I am treating these words as interchangeable- was changed in the system prompt, it would make sense that Grok’s interpretation of it to be the opposite of aware of social biases, which is to further the social biases."

    "text": "Grok, A Case Study in Deepfakes\nWithin the past few weeks, X has had another instance where Grok, and by proxy the entire social media platform, has become unsafe to the typical user. The issue lies once again with system prompts, but the effect was more demonstrated in images rather than hateful rhetoric.\nCertain users found that when prompting Grok, there were less regulation on the image generation side of the AI assistant. Explicit images were now allowed to be generated without warning, resulting in some accounts going to real people’s normal posts and prompting Grok to take their clothes off. Much CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Materials) were generated, the update notably targeting women and children much more negatively than men.\nThis problem exists across all forms of generative AI. People’s likeness and image can be used to create realistic versions doing inappropriate actions that they would never do themselves in real life, and often without any knowledge or permission. Putting someone’s likeness on someone else’s body is known as a deepfake. As generative AI becomes more sophisticated, it becomes harder to tell deepfaked content from real content. With malicious uses of deepfakes such as the one seen by Grok, the consequences are heavily mentally and socially damaging."

    "text": "Doing the Mundane\nIn a more positive swing, I do believe that there are beneficial uses of artificial intelligence. For Large Language Models, they can be used to quicken mundane tasks that would otherwise not require much thinking. In Design Studio, my team and I are creating an AI agent framework that will hasten the speed of manually inputting insurance information using computer vision. The downside of this product is that it will inevitably replace human work, and therefore potentially contribute to job loss as the technology becomes more advanced and accurate.\nThis is the inherent side effect of most technological advancements. Instead of drying our clothes on a rack where they are hung outside to dry, we invented the dryer. Instead of needing to operate maps and the ever-changing cities and towns we live in, we invented GPS services that live on our phones where all we have to do is type in a destination and we will get a turn-by-turn on how to get there. Instead of doing mathematics by hand, we invented the calculator to crunch numbers for us. Instead of having to fill in document entries, dragging and clicking the mouse over and over, we can use artificial intelligence to read in data and to populate fields for us. Instead of losing the art of real-world navigation, we save our hands minimally from getting carpal tunnel."

    "section": "Machine Learning",
    "text": "Machine Learning\nThe middle ground of computer science and statistics falls right into either programming languages such as R or, more specifically, using machine learning algorithms to analyze data and find hidden patterns. The second semester of my sophomore year, I took the course “Intro to Machine Learning” underneath the school of computing. This semester I am taking “Statistical Learning” underneath the statistics department. I imagine that the content will be the same but the methods and details discussed will be different. The Machine Learning class used Zybooks, an online book application that made the class be able to be taken asynchronously. In contrast, Statistical Learning has no online book to use, purely class discussion. Instead of doing syllabus day, we delved right into a thorough review of Linear Algebra that was more call and response than a stratified lecture. While the class size is much smaller for the statistics department, I can already see the difference between the details of which the content will focus on. Where Intro to Machine Learning remained on the simple python application of machine learning, Statistical Learning will offer much more of the mathematical and statistical intricacies that allow machine learning to exist. Intro to Machine Learning did not even require statistics courses to have been taken before taking the course.\nMachine learning is a vast field with many different types of models that have differing applications depending on the types of data that they are applied to. Binary data is analyzed with a different model or method compared to data such as the price of a good or service. The benefits are vast. Machine Learning can recognize patterns within the data, and handle vast quantities of data and prediction used in many biological fields since they deal with complex structures that cannot be easily quantifiable without the processing power of a computer."

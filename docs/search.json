    "text": "Digital art; Rayne Aurit, November, 2025\nThis piece is one of the first for this year’s submissions into the 2026 edition of the Laurus. This is one of my more recent artworks, one that I felt more looser in creating. The lines are messy, the shapes are there but not refined, and there is little to no rendering. The suggestion of trees and the background mountain speak more than the objects themselves. Things are fuzzier after my department was eliminated. Art is a hobby of mine, yet it is hard to find time to sit down and create. So much of the world today is built on consumption. AI will never be able to replace the feeling of putting down those first few marks, to want to draw mountains and tress. The end product is never the point of creating art, and that is something that I explored more with this piece.\nI am currently writing a synopsis on my opinion on artificial intelligence. I am particularly interested in how it affects my relationship with art in multiple facets: creating art, enjoying others’ art, and criticizing art. AI cannot consciously determine that an artwork needs to be more “scribbly” at will. It has to be prompted, and the “scribbles” are meshed artworks from other people. There is no explanation on why the tree tends to bow out one way and is flimsier at the top, or how the shrubs stick out in a certain way. Nobody is able to take that from AI art without hallucinations, in both the senses of in human and technology."

    "text": "Hello and welcome to the first post on my personal portfolio doubling as a page where I can dispense my thoughts and other items of personal interest.\n\nWhat to Expect\nThis portfolio will consist of updates on my professional journey and projects that I have been working on in class and in my own free time. As a statistics student, my goal of this year in preparing for graduate school is to take on more personal projects, especially as my repertoire of statistical skills becomes more full. With the department set up for elimination officially as of December 5th, 2025, self-study will be my greatest ally in keeping in touch with the knowledge that I have gained in undergraduate school while preparing to leave the state and finding a home for a graduate degree.\nI firmly believe in the goal of being well-rounded and not to narrow in on one specific skill. In addition to data analyses and educational projects, I also will post art projects and other creative projects. Originally, I used to post on Instagram, running an art account, until there was notice of posts on Instagram being scraped to use for training data on Meta’s LLMs and image-generating models. Since then, I have not found a place to host progress in my art journey. For those who are reading this to see data analyses or classwork, I hope you enjoy some color in between the technical writing.\n\n\nNew Year, New Me\nNot quite. Help setting up this portfolio is credited to Dr. Susan Vanderplas through a statistics course on technical writing. I expect that a large portion of updates will be a result of homework and projects from said course as well. Aside from that, my goals for this spring semester include:\n\nFinding 2 data sets to analyze and create visuals for\nPut coursework projects in this portfolio to display the progress of my learning\nSubmit 4 artworks for the Laurus, an undergraduate fine arts magazine\nCreate a new club to support those still interested in statistics despite the department’s elimination\n\nThese goals have no particular ordering as most are long term and will be steadily accomplished simultaneously- aside from artworks for the Laurus. Submissions are due on January 30th of this year and include works created throughout the past year, of which I already have two or three."

    "text": "Colored pencil, marker, newspaper; Rayne Aurit, April, 2025\nI made this collage during a joint meeting of oSTEM@UNL and Mind and Craft. The frog in the chair is simply a coloring page using a variety of colored pencils that were provided, but also marker. For the chair, I used marker and then a lighter color over top the marker whereas the technique used in the rest of the coloring page were marker with a darker color. The lighter colored pencil on top created the texture of felt or velvet, especially since the sides of the couch chair had a darker color, implicating different interactions with light.\nMeanwhile, the background is exempt from all traditional forms of art. They’re ripped clippings from various magazines, mostly vintage aside from the picture frame and the lemons. The frog’s attire seemed to match a more vintage aesthetic, so the clippings I chose reflected that. Colored pencils contrast well with black and white figures and text, emphasizing the frog character over the odd deer held up by two men in the background. They become less obvious easter eggs."

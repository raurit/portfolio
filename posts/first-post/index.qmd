Hello and welcome to the first post on my personal portfolio doubling as a page where I can dispense my thoughts and other items of personal interest.

# What to Expect

This portfolio will consist of updates on my professional journey and projects that I have been working on in class and in my own free time. As a statistics student, my goal of this year in preparing for graduate school is to take on more personal projects, especially as my repertoire of statistical skills becomes more full. With the department set up for elimination officially as of December 5th, 2025, self-study will be my greatest ally in keeping in touch with the knowledge that I have gained in undergraduate school while preparing to leave the state and finding a home for a graduate degree.

I firmly believe in the goal of being well-rounded and not to narrow in on one specific skill. In addition to data analyses and educational projects, I also will post art projects and other creative projects. Originally, I used to post on Instagram, running an art account, until there was notice of posts on Instagram being scraped to use for training data on Meta's LLMs and image-generating models. Since then, I have not found a place to host progress in my art journey. For those who are reading this to see data analyses or classwork, I hope you enjoy some color in between the technical writing.

# New Year, New Me

Not quite. Help setting up this portfolio is credited to Dr. Susan Vanderplas through a statistics course on technical writing. I expect that a large portion of updates will be a result of homework and projects from said course as well. Aside from that, my goals for this spring semester include:

-   Finding 2 data sets to analyze and create visuals for
-   Put coursework projects in this portfolio to display the progress of my learning
-   Submit 4 artworks for the Laurus, an undergraduate fine arts magazine
-   Create a new club to support those still interested in statistics despite the department's elimination

These goals have no particular ordering as most are long term and will be steadily accomplished simultaneously- aside from artworks for the Laurus. Submissions are due on January 30th of this year and include works created throughout the past year, of which I already have two or three.
